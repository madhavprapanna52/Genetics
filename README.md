# Genetics - Fostering Bio-tech
Ultimate GOAL : Identify genetic mutation which can trick human cells into burning fat cells intead to storing it.

Execution Overview
1. Exploring dataset - Plot high dimensional dataset to make sense
2. Making Insights from data to draw out key observations and insights for feature engenearing
3. Crafting Algorithm X ML model, using mutliple logistics at base and training higher CNN for deep learning meta-model
4. Iterating and finetuning our mix-multistage model
