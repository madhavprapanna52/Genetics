#  GOAL : Identify genetic mutation which can trick human cells into burning fat cells intead to storing it.
> We have to develop model and algorithm which can predict the behaviour of cell development when a new unseen gene is turned off

## Problems
* Genetic mutations makes really cascadial changes to the cell, millions of metabolic changes are interconnected and synchronised how we can point and model behaviour of cell with respect to genetic mutation
* What does single-cell RNA sequencing data tells about ?,
    ~ RNA sequence use to tell about how protein synthesis in cell would go about ?
    ~ its translation of the code straight out of main genetic code of cell


    ~ How to Really interpret the internal state and gene expression profile
    ~ What parameters would really nudge into making the classification of cells into different domain
